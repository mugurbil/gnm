Description: gnm
        ===
        
        **The Python sampling toolkit for affine-invariant MCMC**
        
        gnm is a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that uses the Gauss-Newton-Metropolis (GNM) Algorithm.
        
        The code is open source.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        To use the gnm package, the package numpy needs to be installed. For the examples and plotting the results, matplotlib is required. The acor feature demands the installation of the acor package.
        
        From the default packages, one will need os, setuptools (or distutils), re, sys, and copy. These packages likely come with any python installation.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install gnm would be to use pip.
        
        $ pip install gnm
        
        To download manually, use git clone or download as zip (see right hand side). 
        
        $ git clone https://github.com/mugurbil/gnm.git
        
        Then you can install manually by going into the gnm directory, and then runing setup.py.
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        To clean the repository after installation, one can run clean with setup.py.
        
        $ python setup.py clean
